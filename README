This file describes the COMSOL implementation of a polycyrstal plasticity model
with grain boundary evolution developed in the paper:

    N. C. Admal, G. Po, J. Marian. ?A unified framework for polycrystal 
    plasticity with grain boundary evolution.? 
    arXiv preprint arXiv:1709.10176, 2017. 
    Submitted to International Journal of Plasticity

A boundary-value-problem is simulated in COMSOL for a two-dimensional bicrystal with a
circular grain embedded inside a square domain. This is a simulation of the
shrinking grian boundary without grain rotation. See the above reference for additional details
regarding the model. For comparison purposes, we also simulate an equivalent KWC
model.

The directory consists of the files
     README
     expressions.m
         levCiv.m
     pcp_circular.mph
         poldecomp.m
         latticeRotation.m

Following are steps to be followed to run the poly_cp.mph:

1) Run 'expressions.m' (depends on 'levCiv.m'), a matlab file used to generate the following 
   three .txt files: 1) parameters.txt, 2) variables.txt and 3) pde.txt. These
   files are used as input for material parameters, variable definitions and weak
   form pdes in COMSOL v5.2 file 'pcp_circular.mph'. 

2) Open the 'pcp_circular.mph' COMSOL file. The 'pcp_circular.mph' file, in its current form, has the 
   parameters, variables and pdes already inputted. So, step 2 above may be skipped. Instead, if you 
   intend to make any changes to the model by altering the expressions.m file, then the new 
   parameters.txt, variables.txt and the pde.txt files are to be included as follows:

   The files parameters.txt and variables.txt are uploaded in 
   the tabs (of COMSOL v5.2)

       Global Definitions -> parameters,
       Component 1 -> Definition -> variables,

   respectively. The weak-form pdes in the file 'pde.txt' are pasted into the four
   PHYSICS tabs:

       Slips           -> Weak Form PDE1
       Force Balance   -> Weak Form PDE1
       Flow Rule       -> Weak Form PDE1
       Phi             -> Weak Form PDE1
       kwc             -> Weak Form PDE1

   The first four listed above correspond to the polcyrstal plasticity model,
   which are solved in the 'ge_study' STUDY . The last physics tab is solved in
   the 'kwc_study' STUDY which corresponds to the KWC model. The files 'poldecomp.m' and
   'latticeRotation.m' are matlab functions used by COMSOL to plot lattice rotation using
   polar decomposition.

3) Run 'pcp_circular.mph'
